# myarchinstall
i'm planning on using arch so of course i need to use commands so i'm documenting this on github so it will be easier 

step 1 installing arch using iso from arch website and using archinstall command so i don't have to go though the disk commands 
make sure to use LTS kernal cause i'm running a older pc (rx 7600 and a ryzen 5700X) and make sure to install the network part

step 2 after everything is installed first download flatpak using sudo pacman -S flatpak and aur using SomeOrdinaryGamers video

Firefox sudo pacman -s firefox
Chromium sudo pacman -S chromium
